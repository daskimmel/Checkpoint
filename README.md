An android application for saving your favorite locations

Originally done for a school project, I was young and the code leaves a lot to be desired.
There's a ton that can be improved.
Maybe when I get some time I will swing back around and button it up.

At this moment, the color picker isn't working cause it was a separate project and the map was built in 5 years ago and needs some updates to work correctly.
I might do something about it when I can get around to it.
